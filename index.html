            <p>Early in my working life I spent several years working on the production floor of a factory. One of the
                things that I learned there that is most applicable to my career in tech was a lot of practice with
                troubleshooting. Things would go wrong from time to time and often I would be the first person to try to
                figure out the what and why, and of course if I couldn't fix it then I would have to describe the issue
                to the maintanence person who would be next in line to diagnose the issue.</p>
            <p>My first tech related position was (among other things) doing application support in a call center. In
                this role one of my duties was to identify bugs reported by users of the software that the company
                wrote, reproduce them, and send them up to the developers. Once the developers had a solution I would
                then work with the users to confirm that the issue was resolved.</p>
            <p>My next tech related position was more what a person probably imagines when they think of a tech support
                job. I worked for a government contractor on a remote help desk. I supported just about every device and
                piece of software under the sun. Sometimes it seemed like if it used electricity and a government worker
                used it, then they would call me for help with it. This job definitely expanded my ability to look up
                most any issue to help the callers. I got a lot of experience with gathering the right information to
                understand what the issue was and how to help them get past it.</p>
