                <p>I am an experienced IT Help Desk person trying to navigate a career change to software development.</p>
                <p>I've picked up a lot of transferable skills related to troubleshooting and customer service (among other things) from my days in IT. I also have experience facilitating conversations between developers and end users while in an IT role.</p>
                <p>I have completed a certificate in web development at Austin Community College (similar to a bootcamp program) and have done quite a bit of self-directed study.</p>
